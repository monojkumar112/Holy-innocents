              <p>
                Holy Innocents' Chapel was opened in Orpington in 1909 and Holy
                Innocents' became a parish in 1971. We moved down the road to
                our current church premises in 1981. We are privileged to have
                both Holy Innocents' Catholic School and a community of the
                Sisters of Mercy‎ in the parish. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We belong to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark, in the
                Bromley Deanery; and in ecumenical terms we are a proud member
                of Churches Together in Orpington. 
              </p>
              <p>
                But if we are to take seriously Saint John Paul II's description
                of a parish quoted‎ above, it is not these bare, institutional
                facts that define us as a parish. Rather, what matters most is
                what we are like as a family, a fellowship, a welcoming home, a
                community. 
              </p>
              <p>
                We hope that you will get a good sense of that from this
                website, arranged as it is around the different aspects of our
                parish life; and that if you've not already done so, you will
                have the opportunity to come and experience our life and our
                welcome in person.
