          <h4>
            Liturgy is the official, public worship of the Church. The Mass (or
            Eucharist) is our most important liturgy. Some of the other
            well-known forms of liturgy in the Catholic Church are baptisms,
            weddings and funeral
          </h4>
        </div>
        <p>
          The Mass is a celebration of the whole community, not just the priest
          and our deacons. The same is true of our other liturgical services. So
          we encourage as many people as possible to join in the preparation and
          celebration of our Masses and other services.
        </p>
        <p>
          On this page, we talk about various ways (some in the public eye, but
          many behind the scenes) in which this happens. If you want to learn
          more or to volunteer, get in touch with the relevant contact person
          shown below.

                Our altar linen does not launder itself. A group of volunteers
                takes it in turns to home launder the altar clothes and (very
                carefully) iron them.

              <p>
                Our altar servers assist the priests and deacons during Mass and
                other liturgical celebrations. We all like to see younger
                parishioners serving on the sanctuary and any boy or girl is
                welcome to become an altar server at any time after their First
                Holy Communion. But serving is not just the children; we welcome
                the ministry of young people and adult servers just as much.
              </p>
              <p>
                ​We have a well-developed training and development structure for
                our younger altar servers. As a new altar server you first learn
                some practicalities, then you will able to participate on the
                sanctuary at Mass. After that you will take part in an
                eight-week formation period to complete your training. Once you
                have been serving for a short period, we enrol you into
                the Guild of St Stephen.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending on their experience and years of service, each server
                wears a different colour cord attached to a medal. New servers
                begin with a red cord medal.

                    Our eucharistic ministers assist in the distribution of the
                    Eucharist (Holy Communion) at Masses; and some of them also
                    take the Eucharist to people in our local hospitals or in
                    their homes. Eucharistic ministers are chosen by Father
                    Victor and commissioned by the Diocese following
                    instruction. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each eucharistic minister will generally appear on the rota
                    for their Saturday evening/Sunday Mass about once a month.

              <p>
                The formal name for eucharistic ministers is ‘Extraordinary
                Ministers of the Eucharist’ (priests and deacons being the
                ‘ordinary’ ministers). They renew their promises once a year,
                very appropriately on the feast of the body and blood of Christ
                (or ‘Corpus Christi’, to give it its traditional name). 
              </p>
              <p>
                Our eucharistic ministers are required to deepen their own
                practice and understanding of the faith, and obligated to attend
                a day of formation each year; a practice which Father Victor
                recommends for all those involved in any ministry in the parish.

                Flower arrangements can be beautiful and uplifting. We are
                blessed by the talents of those who arrange the flowers for us
                at Holy Innocents&apos;, including those on the sanctuary around
                the altar.
              </p>
              <p>
                They also arrange flowers for major seasons, such as Christmas

                weddings.

                ​Our organ was specially designed for Holy Innocents’ by Herr
                Spath of what was then West Germany. It is a two-manual tracker
                action pipe organ, and is particularly suited for the music of
                the period of J S Bach. It is perfect for the accompaniment of
                congregational singing, which it supports but cannot overwhelm.

                    The proclamation of readings from the Bible, the Word of
                    God, forms a central part of our worship. It is a privilege,
                    but also a great responsibility, to read at Mass or another
                    service. More than 65 parishioners, young and old, regularly
                    rise to the challenge.
