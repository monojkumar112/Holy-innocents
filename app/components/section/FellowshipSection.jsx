              <p>
                The Bible passage quoted above is perhaps the most famous
                description of the early Christian church. As you might expect,
                the first followers of Jesus were devoted to spiritual matters,
                such as the teaching of the apostles and the prayers. But they
                also devoted themselves to 'the communal life' – what we might
                now call 'the fellowship'.
              </p>
              <p>
                All that we do together contributes to our communal life, our
                fellowship. We think of the Eucharist, for example, as the
                source and summit of everything we do as a parish. On these 'Our
                fellowship' pages, we look at those areas of activity which are
                especially focused on keeping our community running smoothly and
                developing our sense of togetherness:
