                <p>
                  Jesus wants His disciples to be people of prayer, always
                  growing in their faith. The Gospels show us that Jesus prayed
                  often. He encouraged His disciples to pray; and He devoted
                  much of His time to helping them develop their fledging faith.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Holy Innocents’, we try to follow Jesus’ example by being,
                  in the words of our Parish Vision, &apos;rooted in
                  prayer&apos;, and by learning how to become the disciples
                  Jesus wants us to be.

            <h1>What is formation?</h1>
            <p>
              Jesus didn&apos;t just teach his disciples. Rather, he formed them
              -in other words, he showed them how he wanted them to live by
              teaching, challenging, encouraging and occasionally rebuking them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Above all, he showed them by the example of his own life. This is
              why the Catholic Church believes that the &apos;formation&apos; of
              every Catholic - ​not just priests and deacons - is so important

                  Lectio Divina literally means &quot;Divine Reading&quot;.

                  of the Lord through listening to, pondering on and praying the
                  Word of God. We hold a Lectio Divina evening each month in the
