            <h1>What is formation?</h1>
            <p>
              Jesus didn&apos;t just teach his disciples. Rather, he formed them
              -in other words, he showed them how he wanted them to live by
              teaching, challenging, encouraging and occasionally rebuking them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Above all, he showed them by the example of his own life. This is
              why the Catholic Church believes that the &apos;formation&apos; of
              every Catholic - ​not just priests and deacons - is so important

                <p>
                  Lectio Divina literally means &quot;Divine Reading&quot;.
                  It is an ancient form of praying and experiencing the presence
                  of the Lord through listening to, pondering on and praying the
                  Word of God. We hold a Lectio Divina evening each month in the
                  Presbytery, advertised in advance in the weekly newsletter, to
                  which all are welcome.
